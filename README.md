About My Self

Hello, my name is Ivandohan. I'm a newbie programmer.

I have skills to code C/C++, PHP, Java, Python, Javascript, Golang, and Dart.

I got intrigued in Laravel programming when I initially started college. 
But as time passed, I became more interested in the most recent Backend technology such as
Golang, and Javascript.

And as I learned more, I became more interested in Mobile App development by using Dart Flutter.
What a waste of time XD.
